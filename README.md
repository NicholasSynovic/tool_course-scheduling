## About

Department chairpersons at Loyola University Chicago (LUC) regularly evaluate
and compare the enrollments of students in department courses. This is often a
manual process involving computing metrics and conducting analysis from a
generated spreadsheet. While different departments have different requirements,
comparisons, and analysis to evaluate their data, many of these comparisons are
similar to other departments. To facilitate communication between department
chairpersons, faculty, and LUC administration, as well as to provide equal
access to these analysis regardless of technical competance, we are releasing
the Loyola University Chicago Course Scheduling Utility (`luc-cs`).
